# Data-Science-Project

This project includes the solution to the quant case studies. Each case question is solved in a separate Jupyter Notebook.

In order to ensure that the notebooks are reproducible, I have included a list of dependencies in the requirements.txt file.

To install these requirements, open Terminal on Mac or Command line in Windows and run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Case Question 1: Language Classification

The solution for the language classification problem is found in the notebook **language_classification.ipynb**.

The trained models are saved as pickle files (.pkl). In total there are 3 trained models based on the decision tree, random forest, and gradient boost.

These trained models can be loaded as decribed in the notebook and used to classify new data.

## Case Question 2: Pong
